CC0 1.0 Universal

Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific
works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later
claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse
and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any
purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may
contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the
further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain
reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and
efforts of others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation
of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a
Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright
and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work
and publicly distribute the Work under CC0, thereby abandoning all his or her
rights in the Work to the extent allowed by law, and waiving all claims and
associations of infringement, to the extent permitted by law, arising from or
related to use of the Work by others.

The Affirmer hereby grants to each Affected Person a royalty-free, non
transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unrestricted
license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work
(whether already owned or hereafter acquired) for the following purposes:
(i) to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
Collections, to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;
(ii) to create and reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation,
including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly
label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original
Work (for example, "The original work was translated from X to Y.");
(iii) to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in
Collections; and,
(iv) to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
The Affirmer waives all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and
associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work to the extent
possible under the law.

Affirmer's offer of CC0 applies only to the extent the copyright and related
rights do not include any rights in any underlying Work which Affirmer may not
be able to waive (for example, trademark or patent rights). For avoidance of
doubt, Affirmer disclaims all interest in any copyright and related rights
which may exist in any underlying Work.
